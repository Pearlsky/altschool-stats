This is a my personal demo of an holiday challenge by Altschool Africa. It's one of the team projects for the Hackathon which every circle of Altschool Africa's students have been asked to participate in. Yes, we have groups and they are cooly called "circles".

The idea is to build a dashboard to show the following stats and summaries

    - How many courses a given instructor is taking
    - How many students are in each of the tracks (frontend, backend and cloud)
    - How many students are male, female or other genders/orientation
    - Minimum, maximum, and average age of students in the school

Disclaimer: The details used for the stats in this project would represent nth close to accurate details, yet, I must build my project.

I intend to build this with HTML, SCSS and Vanilla JS
